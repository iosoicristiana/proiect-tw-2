        <h4> Overview </h4>
	<p>Black Sails is an American historical adventure television series set on New Providence Island and written to be a prequel to Robert Louis Stevenson's 1883 novel <a href="./altceva.html"> Treasure Island </a>. The series was created by Jonathan E. Steinberg and Robert Levine for Starz. It debuted online for free on YouTube and other various streaming platform and video-on-demand services on January 18, 2014. The debut on cable television followed a week later on January 25, 2014. Steinberg is executive producer, alongside Michael Bay, Brad Fuller and Andrew Form, while Michael Angeli, Doris Egan, and Levine are co-executive producers. The show features treasure-seeking pirates fending off British government attempts to stop them.</p>

    <p>Black Sails is set in the early 18th century, roughly two decades before the events of Treasure Island, during the Golden Age of Piracy. Feared Captain Flint brings on a younger crew member as they fight for the survival of New Providence island. According to the first episode, "In 1715 West Indies, the pirates of New Providence Island threaten maritime trade in the region. The laws of every civilized nation declare them hostis humani generis, enemies of all mankind. In response, the pirates adhere to a doctrine of their own....war against the world."

    <h4> Themes </h4>
    <p>Over the course of its run, the series explores complex narratives of ambition, greed, and betrayal. It features an array of complicated, ruthless women, all given the sorts of roles that are too often denied to female characters in historical pieces such as this. From Eleanor Guthrie, a woman determined to forge a place for herself in a man’s world, to the perpetually scheming brothel madam Max, who simply desires to maintain her own power at any cost, and the legendary Bonny, who plays down her femininity so that she might be taken more seriously by the men she crews with, these are all female characters who lead refreshingly rich lives.
        But again, despite all its bluster and bloodshed, Black Sails is really a story about storytelling. Given that the series has its roots in classic fiction, it’s not surprising that it is primarily concerned with the people who tell those stories: Are they reliable narrators? How close are their stories to the truth of what actually happened? And how much does it even matter if they’re not?</p>

    <h4> Quotes </h4>
    <p id="first_q"> <i> “This is how they survive. You must know this. You're too smart not to know this. They paint the world full of shadows... and then tell their children to stay close to the light. Their light. Their reasons, their judgments. Because in the darkness, there be dragons. But it isn't true. We can prove that it isn't true. In the dark, there is discovery, there is possibility, there is freedom in the dark once someone has illuminated it. And who has been so close to doing it as we are right now?” </i></p>
    <p id="second_q"> <i>  “A story is true, a story is untrue. As time extends, it matters less and less. The stories we want to believe, those are the ones that survive, despite upheaval and transition and progress. Those are the stories that shape history. And then what does it matter if it was true when it was born? It's found truth in its maturity. Which if a virtue in man ought to be no less so for the things men create.” </i></p>
    <p id="third_q"> <i> "The Empire survives in part because we believe its survival to be inevitable. It isn’t. And they know that. That’s why they’re so terrified of you and I. If we are able to take Nassau, if we are able to expose the illusion that England is not inevitable. If we are able to incite a revolt that spreads across the New World... then yeah, I imagine people are going to notice." </i></p>
    <p id="fourth_q"> <i> "These men who brought me here today do not fear me. They brought me here today because they fear you... because they know my voice - the voice that refuses to be enslaved - once lived in you, and may yet still. They brought you here today to show you death and use if to frighten you into ignoring that voice. But know this. We are many. They are few. To fear death is a choice... and they can't hang us all." </i></p>
