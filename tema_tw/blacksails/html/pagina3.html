            <h3>Ancient Piracy</h3>
           <p> Pirates have been around for centuries, with the earlier recording of the same being in 1350 BC. It was a clay tablet that documented a pirates’ ship attacking an area in North Africa. During ancient Greek and Roman times, piracy was commonplace. Ships during that time were not as sophisticated and would sail near the coast, which made them an easy target for pirates. </p>
            <h3> The Golden Age of Piracy</h3>
           <p> There were many factors that contributed to the Golden Age of Piracy in the late 17th and early 18th century, including a rise in the quantities of valuable cargo being transported across the vast Atlantic Ocean. Coupled with the fact that most of the major colonial empires of the time; the British, the French, the Spanish, the Dutch, the Danish, Portuguese and many others were at war in Europe and did not have the men or ships to effectively govern any of their colonial territories at the time created an atmosphere of little to no law or authority. This led to experienced sailors and privateers taking advantage of a ripe opportunity to take over valuable cargo without risking a rapid colonial response. </p>
           <p>The Golden Age of Piracy was a era in which the occupation of piracy flourished like no other time before in history. Pirates and privateers alike in this time period were able to amass massive fortunes and virtually halt trade in the West Indies. The Golden Age of Piracy can be sub-divided into four major eras, the Privateering Era in the 16th century, the Buccaneering Era in the 17th century, the Pirate Round of the late 17th and 18th centuries and finally the infamous Post Spanish Succession Period of the 18th century during which piracy reached its peak and resulted in many of the famous pirates we know today such as Edward 'Blackbeard' Teach. </p>
           <h3> Privateering Era</h3>
           <p> In the beginning of the 16th century the Spanish had conquered the New World empires of the Aztec and Inca and were beginning to transport the massive wealth back to Europe. However, the other colonial powers at the time chiefly England, France and the Dutch Republic seized upon this opportunity to attack Spanish ships and plunder their wealth. During the early 16th century this practice was not called piracy but privateering and was sanctioned by the sovereigns at the time through letters of marque. This era saw the rise of the famous English Sea Dogs such as Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh as well as the French Corsairs such as Jean Fleury and the Dutch Sea Beggars as well as many more. </p>
         <h3> Buccaneering Era </h3>
           <p> The buccaneering era was a period of French, British and Dutch privateering and piracy in the Caribbean mostly launched from the Locations of Tortuga and Port Royal. This era saw the rise of famous buccaneers and corsairs such as Henry Morgan and Francois L’Ollonais who laid the framework for piracy for the rest of the 17th century and part of the 18th century.</p> 
            <p> The Buccaneering Era rose out of the Privateering Era and the discovery of the New World by Christopher Columbus due to the massive wealth of riches that the Spanish Empire began moving out of the Spanish Main and the Spanish West Indies. However, in the beginning Spain claimed all of the New World as one massive colony. This was unsustainable given the massive amount of territory and as the discovery became public knowledge every other empire raced to the New World to claim their piece of the territory. What resulted was a bloody and ruthless battle waged through acknowledged wars and illegitimate piracy that helped shape the world as we see it today.            </p>
